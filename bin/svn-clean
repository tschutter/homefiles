#
# * Both ignored and untracked files are deleted.
# * It works even if a file name contains whitespace (except for
#   newline, but there's not much that can be done about that other
#   than use the --xml option and parse the resulting xml output).
# * It works even if svn status prints other status characters before
#   the file name (which it shouldn't because the files are not
#   tracked, but just in case...).
# * It should work on any POSIX-compliant system.

svn status --no-ignore | grep '^[I?]' | cut -c 9- | while IFS= read -r f; do ${CMD} "$f"; done
