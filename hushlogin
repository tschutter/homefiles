Existence of ~/.hushlogin suppresses printing of system messages
including the contents of /etc/motd and last login messages.

If motd is still not suppressed, it probably is being emitted by pam
or by the "Banner" keyword in /etc/sshd_config.  Use "LogLevel quiet"
in ~/.ssh/config to suppress it in either case.
