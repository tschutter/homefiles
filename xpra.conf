# Configuration file for xpra.
#
# xpra is surperior performance to normal X forwarding "ssh -X", especially
# for apps with high rendering bandwidth such as web browsers.
#
# Examples:
#   xpra start ssh/HOST/100
#

# Client options (attach).

# For each window created by xpra, give a hint that it is a remote window by
# specifying the color and size of an internal window border.
border = auto,1

# Server options (start).

# Copied from /etc/xpra/xpra.conf and
# 1. Removed -logfile because it is only available as root.
# 2. Removed -configdir because it can only be relative with no .. if non-root.
# 3. Changed -config because it can only be relative with no .. if non-root.
# 4. Copied /etc/xpra/xorg.conf to ~/.xpra/
# Also changed "allowed_users=console" to "allowed_users=anybody" in /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
